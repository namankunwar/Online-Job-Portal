This is an online jobportal i have made during my 6th sem summer project. First, we have to organize the files here. put all the folders likes media, project, portal_1 inside the storefront folder. then install django and python, pillow and run the code.
Note: i have used the template here for the frontend part. also i haven't used default admin dashboard given by django.
